# Turq
Turq is a game engine I am working on using the LWJGL library for Java.
I decided to upload this (and all future projects) to git as it will allow any future employeers to see
some of the projects I have made.


# Why 'Turq'?
I chose the name 'Turq' as it's a shortening of 'Turqouise', my fianc√©e's birthstone.
Although that name is subject to change, it will relate to her in some way.
